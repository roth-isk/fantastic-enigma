    <p>Sunflowers are known for their bright and cheerful appearance. With their golden-yellow petals, sunflowers symbolize happiness and warmth. These vibrant flowers have a unique ability to turn and follow the sun throughout the day, a behavior known as heliotropism. Enjoy the beauty and positivity that sunflowers bring to any environment!</p>
